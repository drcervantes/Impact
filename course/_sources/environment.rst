Using the Learning Environment
=======================================

An important skill to develop when using any software (or anything with an interface really), is the ability to identify and learn the functionality of all the tools available to you, the user. Consider playing a video game: a successful player is one who has mastered all of the gameplay options available so as to maximize the highest reward for their efforts.

The same holds true for our learning environment. To receive the strongest learning experience, it is crucial to understand how the learning environment operates.


The Program Window
::::::::::::::::::

Let's begin by learning about the program window. At the end of this section, you should see the following items: a run button, a history slider, a white text box for user input, a gray box for text output, and a graph.

Now let's cover each of these items with a bit more of an explanation. First up is the white text box. Inside of this box, a user can add text, or code, as is the case in our situation. You should also notice the incrementing numbers of the left side of the box. These are called line numbers and are very useful when locating mistakes in our code, which will be shown in just a little bit.

Once we have written some code into this box, we can then use the run button. This tells the learning environment to go ahead and take your code, interpret it, and display the output of the code.

Depending on the type of output, the result of the code will either be drawn on the graph or printed in the gray text output box.

The last item to cover is the history slider. Every time you edit and run your code, the learning environment remembers the previous state of your code. This makes it easy for a user to backtrack changes that were made.
